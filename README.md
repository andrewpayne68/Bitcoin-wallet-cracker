**Programmed in Python3 | PySimpleGUI**

# Bitcoin wallet cracker
Code Generates valid Bitcoin addresses/private keys derived from BIP39 Mnemonic Words and compares to a database text file containing Bitcoin Wallet Addresses with Balances (file: data-base)


# Usage:
### Python3+

```
git clone https://github.com/andrewpayne68/Bitcoin-wallet-cracker.git

cd Bitcoin-wallet-cracker && pip3 install -r requirements.txt && sudo apt install python3-tk -y

python3 bc.py
```

# Proof of Concept/How it works
Although this project can be used maliciously, it is simply an 
exploration into the Bitcoin protocol and advanced encryption and 
hashing techniques using Python.




**Address with balance is saved in win.txt file**
